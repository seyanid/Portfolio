    <p class="Like">As a soon to be Sophomore, there’s a lot I can say about myself.Furthermore, I have been in a few girl groups in which we build sisterly relationships with each other all while doing great things for the community. Some of my favorite things to do are to dance and model which is why I joined dance team in school and have participated in fashion shows. Some things that I like about myself are that I’m a leader, I’m positive, have patience and I’m very great at babysitting. I attended Grover Cleveland Mastery Charter for all my elementary and middle school years. Then, I graduated with almost getting Valedictorian. Then, I went to Parkway Center City Middle College.

        <p class="Like">At Parkway, I’m currently in a program in which I take college courses at Community College of Philadelphia. These classes will contribute to us getting an associate’s degree in Liberal Arts along with our high school diploma when I graduate. In school is when I learned about SMASH Academy. As soon as I heard about it, I wanted to join. I loved the idea of getting into a free prestigious program for under- represented students in which I would be staying on a real college campus, gaining relationships and  learning new things.</p>
